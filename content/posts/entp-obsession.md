Now, although I have personal experience with this, and can vouch for two other ENTPs that I know personally. There doesn't seem to be much 'science' or data talking about ENTPS becoming obsessed and disinterested, but I would suspect it is something to do with the fact they are Starter types, and being a starter can carry over into everything, passions, hobbies, jobs and even relationships. However, browsing through many forums and groups I can see this is a common theme for ENTPs, just as those that are in a relationship with them asking for others advice on how to deal with it.

Also understand, that once ENTPs mature, they can be one of the most loyal and committed out of all of the types due to Si inferior (which is aspirational, and tends to have the most motivation and willpower out of all the functions when one chooses to apply it.

So today, I am going to go through two things with you, why an ENTP is crazy and fanatically obsessed and then loses disinterest, and tips on how to deal with it (but also how to deal with yourself)

**WHY ARE ENTPS LIKE THIS?**


1. **Entps are starter types:** This means that their brain is wired to enjoy starting new things, projects, and even relationships. ENTPs will get a rush of dopamine when something is new and to be discovered. They love planning their new projects out, and learning everything about them, but after that it can become boring and loses 'steam'. Another issue, when ENTPs are emotionally immature and don't yet realise this cycle with people, they may continue to play it out, instead of stepping back to notice that their obsession and disinterest has manifested before with other people. I now know to look harder when I become obsessed with someone and show interest and flatter them and shower them with love, because I realise now it is just 'what I don't know' about someone that is making me feel that way, not the 'person', and that takes time for me to figure out. I take more time, I don't jump in head first, which could end up wasting our time. But most young ENTPs are innocent, interested, and have no idea! They also dive into new projects and jobs and hobbies this way too, thinking it is now the 'be alll and end all', they are not yet aware that this is another 'cycle'.

2. **ENTPs are more sensitive than you think with 'FE' child** I can usually tell when I am starting to lose interest. Due to my past relationships, where I hurt others from periods of withdrawing, I start to anticipate that this will happen again with a new person, I begin to get empathic, scared, and worried that I will end up causing another person pain for not being more 'careful' and diving in head first before knowing if me and another person are really right for eachother. I also get worried that if another person really likes me that they could cross my 'Fe' boundaries, and begin realising that their emotions can sometimes control me and cause me to feel guilty. I can't always stop myself from feeling guilty, but know its my own issue, and sometimes spend months recovering from hurting someone else (withdrawing and choosing not to speak to anyone), if I start noticing this happening at all, I will begin to distance myself slowly and stealthily.

3. **ENTPs are extremely loyal** Although there are stereotypes about us for being the most 'flighty' and non-comittal of all the types. Si 'inferior and aspirational' means we have the capibility to be more loyal and dutiful than anyone else. I still care for my very first boyfriend and think of him fondly. I still worry and would do anything for my longest standing friends. Once I am loyal, I am diehard loyal (and this tends to annoy me and frustrate me sometimes, as I have put myself in doormat situations). If I begin to lose interest in someone, or just want to retreat, I get scared sometimes that if I continue the relationship (that doesn't appear to be that highly compatible), I will become loyal to a point that is not good for either of us.

4. **ENTPs take time to emotionally mature** We can spend our 20s, even our 30s, chasing and experimenting with all kinds of things, and I believe there is a reason for this, but if an ENTP is twenty-five or under I would be wary, as they probably don't really know what they want.

5. **ENTPS can go through social cycles** Sometimes its really not personal,  I just don't want to talk to anyone for months. ENTPs can get drained from 'over gathering' with their NE, burn out, and go into periods of not wanting to gather any more information, but rather assimilate it. It happens to me all the time, and just because I am distant with my friends doesn't mean I don't love them anymore, this is just what happens with me.

**TIPS FOR DEALING WITH THIS**

1. If an ENTP is coming on strong, and is twenty-five years old or less, keep your distance, take your time, and focus on you. An ENTP doesn't even realise they are doing it, but they will put on an extravagant show, shower you with love and affection and gifts just to suck all the information out of you. But you have to become aware of whether they just want to know everything about you, or whether they want you and this can take time

2. Watch them. Is this an obsession/disinterest cycle, or is it a social/anti-social cycle. You could even question your ENTP casually like this: 'Do you find sometimes you are very social and then you retreat?'. However, if you really want to be with them, and you can handle this cycle, then you must play your cards well during this time. If I notice that someone is not understanding me during my withdrawn stage, they get angry with me, or they are attached and needy, I will cut them off, not just for my own good but for theirs, as I know that this cycle is something that I go through often and I can't help. If they can't prevent themselves from going through pain, I will have to do it for them. Do not cross my Fe boundaries or I will decide to cut you out. This may be what happens with a lot of ENTPs, during the period they lost interest, they could intrinsically feel or 'know' the other person wasn't happy with it. This makes us withdraw even further, feeling cold and misunderstood.

3. Play hard to get. It sucks that this works for me, but it does, and one of my good ENFP friends even pointed it out. What's really going on is not that playing hard to get will make me 'want you more', it actually just relieves pressure from me. If I feel you are not so interested or invested in me, and completely okay and having fun living your own life. I feel less pressured and anxious when socially withdrawn from you, meaning I am not associating a feeling of 'anxiety' with you, which may cause me to pull away.

4. Work on yourself and grow with this time. It's always better if the ENTP comes back to a new and improved version of you, someone that has grown and has new information and knowledge to share

5. Really decide if this is okay with you. If an ENTP goes through these cycles, you need to decide if thatâ€™s actually a good thing for you. If you are a type that likes to work on your own stuff and grow or study etc, this could be a really good thing, as you can take more time for yourself and focus on your goals. But don't string yourself or the ENTP along if you are really unhappy and resentful deep down that the ENTP is like this, because then they aren't right for you, and you need to move on as quickly as possible and stop wasting your time.
