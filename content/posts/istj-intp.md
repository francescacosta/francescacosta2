In this post I want to talk about what it's been like for both me and my partner in our relationship, the positives, the negatives, and the frustrations.

My partner Felipe (ISTJ) was instantly drawn to me due to my NeTi. He thought I was extremely rare and was lit up by what I liked to think and talk about. Even though, I warned him before getting into a relationship with me, he jumped in eagerly.

Some of my concerns for our partnership at the beginning where very clear to me, and I laid them out:

- I told him I had trouble committing as I often didn't really know what I wanted and always changed my mind

- I mentioned that I really like things to go my own way and can be quite selfish

- I often change moods, personalities, jobs, and interests, and this has really frustrated more 'structured' 'finisher' types in my life, like I could clearly see that he was

However he decided to jump in, fresh in love with his rose coloured glasses on, not really seeing how any of that would be a problem.

Here are some of the problems we face:
- he is concrete I am abstract
- He is rational I am logical
- He likes to work hard, I like to go with the flow
- He likes security and to prepare for the future, I like to constantly spend my time starting new projects rather than focusing on one and developing it to bring me more money, or work all the time to 'secure my future', as I don't feel I could be really happy if I knew I worked my life away without exploring my own things	- I am messy and disorganised, he is clean and usually finds himself picking up after me (growth)
- He is strict and has some hard and fast beliefs about the world, and I am more open refusing to believe in things
- He likes things to be right or wrong, I like to argue against his version of right and wrong
- I like to debate, he hates arguing with me
- He thinks I am stupid (sometimes), and I don't respect his way of thinking, personally my way of thinking to me is more open to truth and therefore the one I want to keep
- We both want to receive experience with SI, but me having SI inferior (which is a negative function slot, my anxiety revolves around receiving a good experience so I am more strong about getting what I want)
- We have to avoid lots of topics and 'agree to disagree', but not just that, not even able to bring some things up as with his Te, he can be quite fixed and end up feeling so justified and 'right' and therefore ends up trying to sway me to his side.

The positives
- We balance eachother
- I try to take up more creative and interesting tasks for us like cooking new recipes and he likes to try and help me with the mundane tasks that bore me such as cleaning and organising
- He has taught me a lot about money
- He has helped me secure a new job that I love so I find it easier to work
- I teach him how to relax and have helped him realise he has anxious tendencies and a negative viewpoint on the world
- I help him go with the flow and become more positive
- We are very kind and affectionate towards eachother when it works
- He does really want me to be happy, enjoy freedom to do what I want and have financial freedom, the problem is sometimes he can force his 'hard working' ethic onto me, which I don't feel I need to really get by and would prefer to manifest something that is easier and takes me more with the flow

It's been an uphill battle for sure, but one thing we know is that we really love each other and want to try and make it work. We really know now that we have to underst each other and not just 'agreeing to disagree'. At least 'respecting' how the other see's life is the answer. If I was with another intuitive, I wouldn't necessarily have to always battle and try to explain myself. Knowing about this science is what has saved us, and is what will probably allow us to stay together despite the fact we both aren't patient. We both are happy on our own and ready to move on at any time, so without this science and me explaining how different we are, we probably would have called it off by now. But I believe that if we can truly understand and respect each other that we can make it work, but that is going to take being kind to each other, respecting, and hopefully appreciating one another's way of thinking in the end.

I hope this helps. Don't forget to leave a like and subscribe to my channel to help me evolve the content and the message.
