Hey guys,

I hope you are all doing wonderfully.

This post is about achieving happiness through the integration of your subconscious. In this one, we will talk about becoming the 'seed' of the opposite that exists within you (keep in mind this is not talking about an ENTPs maturity, which is actually integrating the functions of the INTJ, this is about the ENTPS happiness).

If you are an ENTP stick around as at the end of the post I will tell you four things that can make you truly happy as you mature in life. If you love an ENTP or are in a relationship with one, also stick around, as it might be helpful to understand that this is the process that is unfolding in an ENTP (So there is no need to push them, or act in ways that may eventually cause them to leave you or feel controlled by you, if you are wanting any of these traits to develop yourself).

When I think about the concept of the ENTP integrating ISFJ subconscious, I see the Chinese symbol for 'yin and yang'. The small dot of one within the other, and this is what is happening with our subconscious, being one way in your ego as an ENTP automatically creates within you the seed of the opposite, which is ISFJ. Another way to think of this concept is with night and day. At the very beginning of the day, it is already turning 'night', or when you have hot water, eventually cools down.

As ENTPs contain the 'ISFJ' subconscious, or the 'Seed' of ISFJ within them, the traits of the ISFJ are originally ones the ENTP may abhor, and actively try to get away from. Good luck if your mother or father are ISFJ's. Yet as ENTPs move through life, they will eventually come to a place where they find the most happiness and joy in holding traditions (Perhaps their own, or ones they create within their family), being loyal, caring for others, and protecting those that they care about. After exhausting all their different interests in life, and coming to a more balanced place, they might find more comfort in taking nice strolls in nature, cooking a nice meal for themselves and their family, or taking care of themselves.

So now lets look at some of these cognitive functions and why it might be best for the ENTP to integrate them into their life to find ultimate happiness and balance.

SI (Introverted Sensing)

FE (Extroverted Feeling)

TI (Introverted Thinking)

NE (Extroverted Intuition)

As you can see from these functions, ENTPs actually have all four of these the same, yet the order is swapped around. There is debate amongst different research in the community that the ISFJ is potentially the best romantic partner for an ENTP because they are the ENTPs dual, therefore together, the couple can take on more angles and facets of life with their intuition and sensing teaming up. However, there is also the other side of the coin, where people argue that its much better to either have the 'sensing' and 'intuition' in common with another partner, otherwise it will make it difficult to understand each other making it unfulfilling, draining, and diminishing for each partner.

Now let's go into four ways the ENTP may find happiness when integrating their ISFJ subconscious.

1. The ENTP will find happiness by learning how to have control over their days

As the ENTP grows, they will find happiness in their life by eventually having control over their day, and making their plans come to fruition, as opposed to being more of a 'movement' type that, where their day happens to them, and they end up going with the flow.

2.The ENTP will find happiness in traditions

Most likely traditions, and routines that they have discovered help them organise their days or their thoughts better

3.The ENTP can find happiness in their loyalty and protection over their loved ones

Although in their younger years, the ENTP may feel uncomfortable, unwanted, and misunderstood, as they get older and learn more about people they will begin to develop deeper and committed relationships, becoming very loyal, and finding joy in taking care of those that make them happy.

4.The ENTP can find value in really taking responsibility for the feelings and happiness of others, or helping others achieve that

With ISFJ subconscious integration, the ENTP will discover they get more joy with being more responsible with others feelings and values. If The ENTP works through the maturation, and holds more of a position of power later in life, feeling more financially settled, and having more free time to be, they will try to help others achieve the life of their dreams too.
