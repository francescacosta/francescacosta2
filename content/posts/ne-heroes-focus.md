You put Extraverted Intuition as a hero/parent function and it's guaranteed you are going to have some sort of focus issue in your life due to the constant scanning of theoretical possibilities, abstract connections, and patterns between people and relationships.

This is why in groups, forums, and chat's we see so many ENTPs complaining they have ADD/ADHD. That they need drugs to focus, or they are on the search for the magic cure that will help them to focus.

Before I go into some tips about what works for me, I am first going to give my opinion on a couple of things and my personal experience.

I studied Chinese Medicine for 3 years, and when you think about NE, this is a very 'yang' process. Yang energy is usually associated with the masculine, the bright, the energetic, and NE gathers information from many different points of possibilities in the environment, and if its not coupled with something more 'Yin' like TI then it has potential to scatter all of the place.

The problem with the ADD/ADHD trend in society, is that many of us are potentially being misdiagnosed, or maybe just aren't aware of the reasons why we could appear this way to a trained medical doctor.Then we are being put on all sorts of drugs to compensate and cause us to act more 'predictable', like the rest of the population, which can alter our brain and our personalities.

For those of you that don't know, I was on Dexamphetamine for about 2 years to combat my lack of focus (its similar to Adderall). Anytime you borrow energy from the body, you are taking it away from your future, talk about abuse.

The fix is not pumping your body with drugs that increase the 'yang' energy of our hero/parent function, but doing more 'yin' type exercising, calming ourselves down, focusing on critical and analytical thinking, writing lists, trying to organise ourselves, etc that will be the key.

The key is also acceptance of ourselves and understanding that NE makes us interested in many things, and maybe that is the way it's meant to be. To try and hone in and focus on one thing, might be blocking a potential process that is happening or an underlying self-actualisation process.

1. You have many interests? Write them all down, take a look at them in priority, do an Ikigai diagram and try to find something that can combine as many of your interests as possible. **Pick three things that you can swing towards if you are going to get bored inevitably.**

2. If the reason you are unfocused is due to having too much 'yang' energy, (for example) you are really interested, energetic, excited by different things, then don't try and speed yourself up even more with coffee or adderall etc (although it may work in the short term its going to cause other issues,) or take them for a very short time to get some integration with your other functions, but then develop strategies to get into a similar mode of mind when doing work without them.

3. If the reason you aren't able to focus is more because you are tired or lazy, or apathetic, then work on your health. No-one is going to want to do anything or focus when they have a lack of energy - which is surprisingly the state you can get into from being too 'excited' drinking too much coffee or being on drugs that are basically speed, its going to take your life force and energy and concentrate it for a short amount of time and leave you depleted. Work on your health, eat well, exercise, find out whats right for your body. Experiment with it

4. Surround yourself with focused people such as INTJ, ENTJ

5. Spend time with yourself, develop your Ti, and develop your Si (it's going to drain you at first so take it in baby steps), find ways to stay committed longer and longer, and work on your endurance
