This post is about my experience as an FE user and the experience of FE users in general. If you are an ENTP, this post will give you some tips for ways to live optimally with FE child. If you are watching to better understand ENTPS then I will give you some insight into how this function works for us, and how you can avoid problems with your ENTPs.

ENTPS have FE in the child slot (third slot), meaning that this is a very innocent and positive function for us, according to the theory of Dr John Bebe who describes the attitudes of each slot. Having FE in the child slot, basically means that you want everyone to feel good, in the most child and innocent like way. Instead of focusing on others 'maturity' and 'emotional growth' an ENTP is more likely to avoid conflict and do anything in the moment to make someone feel better, even if its just a quick fix.

FE users are generally 'absorbers' of peoples feelings, and are more concerned with 'ethics', the groups or overall 'feelings', rather than their own internal 'moral system' or their own personal feelings.

because ENTPs also have FI trickser, which means they don't even really know how they feel inside, this makes it even more difficult for us when we are around other people who are feeling sad, emotional or shameful, as we can tend to adopt those feelings and take them on ourselves.

This can get us in very tricky situations. It's important for ENTPs to understand that they shouldn't be surrounding themselves with emotionally unstable people, because they can absorb those feelings from others. Because I don't always know how I am feeling, I will place more weight an emphasis on how another person is feeling instead, and if this is happening on a consistent basis, we can end up losing ourselves and becoming doormats. Be especially careful of who you live with, its very important for an ENTP to live with someone who is calm and emotionally stable, or you will end up burning out.

So what can we do about this?

If you are an ENTP I have the following advice for you and information for you.

1. contrary to popular belief, growing up, your FE can actually develop before your TI (even though it is the second function) as the second slot where TI is situated generally takes on a critical parent stance, it actually takes more to develop (energetically) than our third function FE, and before we develop enough TI, we can find ourselves in doormat situations, or using NeFe to navigate life and social situations

2. Try to keep your inner circle as emotionally stable as possible. Your desire to help and make people feel better can come out, and it makes us good to use this function, however you will only burn out if you continually surround yourself with people that are unhappy, afraid, ashamed or even guilty.

3. After an emotional encounter, walk away and observe yourself. How do you feel after? Are you now carrying that persons emotions, is it tricking you and becoming your own? Do you feel shame, guilt, or responsibility for the other person's emotion? If you do, go away, work on it, and shine awareness on it, that usually helps dissolve the issue


If you are trying to be a better, friend, partner, or parent to an ENTP, I have the following advice for you.

1. don't cross Fe boundaries
2. Don't ask an ENTP how they feel, ask them what they think
